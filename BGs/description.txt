running BGs.py opens a Terminal window displaying three options:
- register user
- login
- play

BGs.py supports a userbase, keeping track of completed games and levels

starting the play menu through -play, -login or -register and a following login, the user is presented with a list of games and a search query to search for game genres or names. Choosing a game starts that game.
